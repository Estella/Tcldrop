TODO --

Listed in order of priority:

* Eggdrop botnet support.

* partyline support.

* file sharing support (user/channel/etc.)

* Remove support for Eggdrop's .help files.
  (Find some other way of displaying help.)

* Convert the lang code to use msgcat for locales.
  http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/msgcat.htm
  We should still support Eggdrop-style .lang files though.

* More DCC commands.

* MSG commands.

* IRC channel enforcements (+bitch / +autoop / +autovoice / etc.)

* filesys module (needs major work or a rewrite).

* notes module (needs work or a rewrite).

* Consider using TDBC for the databases.

Array to Dict transition:

These are arrays that _might_ should be converted into dicts,
please don't write any more code that uses them directly
until they're removed from this list:

help-files
party_users

Issues where I've (FireEgl) have painted myself into a corner design-wise:

Issue 1:
   When a hostmask is added for a user, commands like [nick2hand] and [hand2nick] won't see any changes.
      This is because the user database is separate from the list of nicks currently on IRC.
      Specifically, the ::database(users) dict is separate from ::nicks array.
   Solutions?
      * We can basically do a [finduser] on every nick!user@host on every single channel the bot is on and update the ::nicks array with the handles we've collected.  This must happen every time a hostmask is added for any user.
         This seems VERY expensive though.  [finduser] in Tcldrop has a much higher overhead than it does in Eggdrop, so it should be avoided when possible (or find a way to reduce its overhead..which is unlikely).
      * ? =(
